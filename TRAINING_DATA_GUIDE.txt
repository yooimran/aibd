📁 AI-BD Training Data Storage Guide
=====================================

🎯 WHERE YOUR TRAINING DATA IS STORED:

📂 Default Location:
   c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\React projects\aiBD\training_data\

📄 Training Data Files:
   ├── conversations.json      → All chat conversations
   ├── feedback.json          → User ratings and feedback  
   ├── learned_patterns.json  → Custom learned responses
   └── trained_model.pkl      → Machine learning model

🔍 DETAILED FILE BREAKDOWN:

1️⃣ conversations.json
   - Stores every conversation between user and AI
   - Format: timestamp, user input, bot response, context
   - Used for: Learning patterns, ML training, analytics

2️⃣ feedback.json  
   - Stores user ratings (👍👎) and feedback comments
   - Format: timestamp, conversation, rating (1-5), feedback text
   - Used for: Improving response quality, learning preferences

3️⃣ learned_patterns.json
   - Custom responses taught by users
   - Positive/negative feedback patterns
   - Format: keywords, responses, learning type
   - Used for: Adaptive responses, avoiding bad responses

4️⃣ trained_model.pkl
   - Machine learning model (created after 10+ conversations)
   - Binary file containing trained AI model
   - Used for: Advanced response prediction, confidence scoring

💾 BACKUP YOUR TRAINING DATA:

Method 1 - Manual Copy:
   Copy entire folder: training_data\ 
   To backup location of your choice

Method 2 - Built-in Export:
   Use web interface → Training Panel → Export Training Data
   Creates: ai_bd_training_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

Method 3 - Script Export:
   python -c "from ai_trainer import AITrainer; AITrainer().export_training_data('my_backup.json')"

📥 IMPORT TRAINING DATA:

To restore or share training data:

Method 1 - Copy Files:
   1. Copy training_data\ folder to AI-BD directory
   2. Restart AI-BD chatbot

Method 2 - Import Function:
   python -c "from ai_trainer import AITrainer; AITrainer().import_training_data('my_backup.json')"

Method 3 - Web Interface:
   Use future import feature in training panel

🗂️ CUSTOMIZE STORAGE LOCATION:

To change where training data is stored:

Edit ai_trainer.py line 32:
   # Default: data_dir="training_data"
   # Custom:  data_dir="C:/MyAI/training_data"

Or set environment variable:
   set AI_BD_DATA_DIR=C:\MyCustomLocation
   
🔄 TRAINING DATA WORKFLOW:

1. Chat with AI-BD → conversations.json updated
2. Rate responses → feedback.json updated  
3. Teach new responses → learned_patterns.json updated
4. 10+ conversations → trained_model.pkl created
5. Export for backup → single JSON file created

📊 MONITOR DATA SIZE:

Check training data size:
   dir "training_data" /s

Typical sizes:
   - conversations.json: 1-10 MB (depends on chat volume)
   - feedback.json: 100KB-1MB  
   - learned_patterns.json: 10-100KB
   - trained_model.pkl: 1-5MB

🛡️ DATA PRIVACY:

Your training data:
   ✅ Stored locally on your computer
   ✅ Never sent to external servers
   ✅ Fully under your control
   ✅ Can be deleted anytime

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

• Training data grows with usage
• Backup regularly if valuable conversations
• Delete training_data\ folder to reset AI
• Share exported files to transfer learning to other AI-BD instances
• Models improve with more diverse conversations

🔧 ADVANCED DATA MANAGEMENT:

View conversation count:
   python -c "from ai_trainer import AITrainer; print(f'Conversations: {len(AITrainer().conversations)}')"

Clear specific data:
   - Delete conversations.json → Reset conversation history
   - Delete feedback.json → Reset ratings
   - Delete learned_patterns.json → Reset custom learning
   - Delete trained_model.pkl → Reset ML model

Merge training data:
   Use import function to combine multiple training exports

📍 QUICK ACCESS COMMANDS:

Open data folder:
   explorer "c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\React projects\aiBD\training_data"

View data files:
   dir "c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\React projects\aiBD\training_data"

Check data status:
   python train_ai.py

Export current data:
   python -c "from ai_trainer import AITrainer; AITrainer().export_training_data()"
